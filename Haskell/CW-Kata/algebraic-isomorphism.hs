module ISO where

import Data.Maybe

-- a type of `Void` have no value.
-- So it is impossible to construct `Void`,
-- unless using undefined, error, unsafeCoerce, infinite recursion, etc
-- And there is a function
-- absurd :: Void -> a
-- That get any value out of `Void`
-- We can do this becuase we can never have void in the zeroth place.

-- Please copy your code of Isomorphism to here.

-- Sometimes, we can treat a Type as a Number:
-- if a Type t has n distinct value, it's Number is n.
-- This is formally called cardinality.
-- See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality

-- Void has cardinality of 0 (we will abreviate it Void is 0).
-- () is 1.
-- Bool is 2.
-- Maybe a is 1 + a.
-- We will be using peano arithmetic so we will write it as S a.

-- GHC will goes like
-- "Found hole `_' with type: (Num (ISO (() -> a) (Maybe b0 -> a0)))"
-- So you can immediately see value of what type are needed
-- This process can be repeat indefinitely -
-- For example you might replace `_` with `isoFunc _ _`
-- So GHC hint you on more specific type.
-- This is especially usefull if you have complex type.
-- See https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/Typed_holes
-- And "stepwise refinement" for more details.
